## What I Studied Today
- Describe Azure identity, access, and security
- Describe cost management in Azure

## Key Concepts Learned
- **Identity vs authentication vs authorization** and how they relate in Azure
- Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra ID) as the core identity service
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for managing permissions to Azure resources
- Difference between **subscriptions**, **management groups**, and **resource groups** for governance
- Azure cost management tools for monitoring, budgeting, and optimizing cloud spend

## What Clicked
- Identity and access management is foundational to Azure security and directly impacts every resource
- RBAC helps enforce least-privilege access without hardcoding permissions
- Cost management is a shared responsibility and must be considered during architecture and deployment, not after
