## Key Concepts Learned

### Azure Compute Services

Azure compute services provide the infrastructure and platforms used to run applications and workloads in the cloud. You learned how to:

- **Compare compute types:**  
  Azure offers different compute options depending on your workload (e.g., Virtual Machines, Containers, Serverless Functions).  
- **Virtual Machines (VMs):** Fully customizable machines running in Azure data centers.  
- **Virtual Machine Scale Sets:** Automatically deploy and scale sets of identical VMs for high availability and load distribution.  
- **Azure Virtual Desktop:** Cloud-based desktop and app virtualization.  
- **Containers and Serverless:**  
  - **Azure Containers & Azure Functions** provide lightweight, scalable execution without managing underlying infrastructure.  
- **Application hosting options:**  
  - You can host apps using Azure Web Apps (App Service), VMs, or containers, depending on control and scalability needs.

### Azure Networking Services

Azure networking services provide connectivity, access control, and communication between resources, users, and networks:

- **Virtual Networks (VNets):** Fundamental building block for Azure networking, enabling resources to communicate privately in Azure.  
- **Subnets & Peering:** VNets can be segmented (subnets) and connected to other VNets (peering) to expand communications across services or regions.  
- **Public & Private Endpoints:**  
  - Public endpoints expose services over the internet.  
  - Private endpoints restrict access to within a VNet or linked networks.  
- **ExpressRoute & VPN Gateway:**  
  - **ExpressRoute** provides dedicated private connectivity between on-premises and Azure.  
  - **VPN Gateway** securely connects on-premises networks over the internet.  
- **Azure DNS:** Managed Domain Name System service for resolving domain names within Azure.

> Networking is key for enabling secure, scalable communication between compute resources and external clients.

## Hands-On / Exercises

This module included exercises showing how to:
- Create a virtual machine (VM)  
- Configure basic network access  
These reinforce how compute and networking integrate in Azure.

## Key Takeaways

- Azure offers **multiple compute options** depending on control, scalability, and workload type.  
- **Networking services** are foundational for communication, reaching both internal resources and external clients.  
- Understanding how compute and networking interact is core to secure Azure infrastructure design — relevant later for **AZ-500 security controls**.
