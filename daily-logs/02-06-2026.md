## Key Concepts Learned

### Azure Compute Services

Azure compute services provide the infrastructure and platforms used to run applications and workloads in the cloud. You learned how to:

- **Compare compute types:**  
  Azure offers different compute options depending on your workload (e.g., Virtual Machines, Containers, Serverless Functions).  
- **Virtual Machines (VMs):** Fully customizable machines running in Azure data centers.  
- **Virtual Machine Scale Sets:** Automatically deploy and scale sets of identical VMs for high availability and load distribution.  
- **Azure Virtual Desktop:** Cloud-based desktop and app virtualization.  
- **Containers and Serverless:**  
  - **Azure Containers & Azure Functions** provide lightweight, scalable execution without managing underlying infrastructure.  
- **Application hosting options:**  
  - You can host apps using Azure Web Apps (App Service), VMs, or containers, depending on control and scalability needs.

### Azure Networking Services

Azure networking services provide connectivity, access control, and communication between resources, users, and networks:

- **Virtual Networks (VNets):** Fundamental building block for Azure networking, enabling resources to communicate privately in Azure.  
- **Subnets & Peering:** VNets can be segmented (subnets) and connected to other VNets (peering) to expand communications across services or regions.  
- **Public & Private Endpoints:**  
  - Public endpoints expose services over the internet.  
  - Private endpoints restrict access to within a VNet or linked networks.  
- **ExpressRoute & VPN Gateway:**  
  - **ExpressRoute** provides dedicated private connectivity between on-premises and Azure.  
  - **VPN Gateway** securely connects on-premises networks over the internet.  
- **Azure DNS:** Managed Domain Name System service for resolving domain names within Azure.

> Networking is key for enabling secure, scalable communication between compute resources and external clients.

## Hands-On / Exercises

This module included exercises showing how to:
- Create a virtual machine (VM)  
- Configure basic network access  
These reinforce how compute and networking integrate in Azure.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Azure offers **multiple compute options** depending on control, scalability, and workload type.  
- **Networking services** are foundational for communication, reaching both internal resources and external clients.  
- Understanding how compute and networking interact is core to secure Azure infrastructure design — relevant later for **AZ-500 security controls**.

### Module: Describe Azure Storage Services

## Key Concepts Learned – Azure Storage

### Overview of Azure Storage
- Azure Storage provides scalable, secure, durable cloud storage solutions for a variety of data types. It supports distributed infrastructure for resilience and high availability.

---

### Storage Accounts & Types
- Storage resources are organized under **storage accounts**, which provide a unique namespace in Azure. 
- Types of storage services within a storage account include:  
  - **Blob Storage** – Object storage for unstructured data (text and binary).  
  - **File Storage** – Fully managed file shares accessible via SMB or REST.  
  - **Queue Storage** – Messaging for communication between components.  
  - **Table Storage** – NoSQL store for structured, schemaless data.  
  - **Disk Storage** – Persistent block storage for Azure VMs.

---

### Storage Tiers
- Blob storage supports **access tiers** (hot, cool, archive) that optimize cost based on how frequently data is accessed.

---

### Redundancy Options
Azure Storage offers several replication models to protect data:
- **Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)** — replicates within a single datacenter.  
- **Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)** — replicates across availability zones.  
- **Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)** — replicates across regions for disaster protection.  
- **Read-Access GRS (RA-GRS)** — provides read access to the secondary region.

---

### Data Movement & Migration Tools
- **AzCopy** — Command-line tool to copy data to/from Azure storage.  
- **Azure Storage Explorer** — UI tool for managing storage accounts and data.  
- **Azure File Sync** — Synchronizes on-premises file servers with Azure Files.  
- **Azure Data Box** & **Azure Migrate** — Tools for large-scale data migration to Azure.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Azure Storage is a flexible, distributed platform supporting multiple storage types suited for different data scenarios.  
- Storage accounts form the foundation for accessing and organizing storage services.  
- Redundancy and data migration options are vital for durability and operational flexibility.
